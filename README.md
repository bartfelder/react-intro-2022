# The global state is evil

That's what a conspiracy theorist would say. But to be honest, global state has its downsides, and not necessarily easy to implement the right way.

State management is one of the more advanced topics and to have the full advantagese of global states, it is advised to use some state management tool. Here Redux is used, but there are a lot of options out there, it's giving them a test run and see what works best for your application.

With global state you can have components access things that are declared much higher up in the component chain without prop drilling. 

But enough about babbling, if you would like to know more visit the Redux and React-Redux sites
