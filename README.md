# Creating components

The real thing happens, when you start using components. There are a lot of packages and modules to provide you with an endless opportunity of predefined components, and you can create your own ones.

And you can create components inside components, inside components, inside components, inside components... It is tiring to write so much, so better create a loop for it.

```
while (true) {
  console.log('inside components')
}
```
Now I've made an infinite loop, are you happy? I've killed a computer, so don't be surprised when Skynet takes me, I deserve it!

But you can see its potentail. I mean reusable components nested into each other.

Imagine a building. You can have rooms and hallways, which are wrapped in floors, that are wrapped in the whole building. Now you can build a house! With React! Say no to homelessness!

What are you waiting for?
