# React intro funny clip cards

What is React, what can you do with it?
Can you create a demo that is not a TODO list?
Yet still more complex than a hello world?

This is it.

You can find the steps as branches on how to progress to this end result which you can see as the main branch

Disclaimer: This is not the most sophisticated and most entertaining react introduction ever, this is just another angle, which hopefully some will find at least tolerable. The design is not great, the code tries to be clean, but could be much cleaner, and there are a lots of thing that are not talked about.

If you want a real react introduction in more detail, here are some recommendations:
- Official React Docs - https://reactjs.org/
- Beta React Docs for more functional componenets - https://beta.reactjs.org/
- Freecodecamp's React tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8
- Traversy Media React tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8

If you are looking for other material, please, consider looking for newer materials, 3-4 year old materials might not be up to date and would lead you down in the wrong rabbit hole
