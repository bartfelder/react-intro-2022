# Static or interactive?

Would you like to play with a single piece of brick, or a game console?

Everybody likes interactivity, and web is not an exception. We like to see stuff move and change. Our adorable little ape brains like that.

So our application should do stuff. Great! More work, just what we asked for!

But how should we know when to do stuff or make stuff happen? That is why states were invented. To record change. I have a big know-all brain that's how I know that, not because I google stuff. Seriously just search for things you don't know. And even things you know, maybe you know it wrong.

And don't believe everything you read, there are a lot of trolls out there.

Here is a training video on how you should avoid being mislead on the internet:
